  I have selected the Corner Grocer project to include in my portfolio. This project addresses the problem of efficiently tracking and analyzing item frequencies from a given input file. By reading the input file containing a list of items, the program creates a frequency list, allowing users to search for specific items, print the frequency list, and visualize the data through a histogram. The primary goal was to develop a functional program that could handle and analyze data efficiently, demonstrating my ability to work with C++ and implement industry-standard coding practices.

  In this project, I believe I did particularly well in organizing the code structure and ensuring the functionality met the requirements. The separation of concerns between reading the input file, processing the data, and interacting with the user interface was effectively managed through the ItemSearch class and its methods. This organization made the program easy to understand and modify. Additionally, I ensured that the code was well-documented and readable, which is essential for maintainability and future enhancements. However, there is always room for improvement. Adding input validation and error handling would make the code more robust and secure. Optimizing the data processing logic could also improve efficiency, especially with larger input files. Implementing multithreading for reading and processing data could significantly speed up performance.

  One of the most challenging aspects of the project was ensuring accurate frequency counting and handling edge cases, such as duplicate items and varying input formats. I overcame this challenge by utilizing standard library functions and data structures, specifically the std::map, to manage item frequencies effectively. To support my development, I referred to C++ documentation and online resources like Stack Overflow for best practices and solutions to specific coding issues. The skills I developed during this project are highly transferable to other projects and coursework. The ability to read and process data files, manage collections of data, and implement user interfaces are fundamental skills in computer science. Additionally, writing well-documented and maintainable code is crucial for collaborative projects and future code reviews. By following industry best practices, using meaningful variable names, consistent indentation, and adding inline comments, I ensured that the program is maintainable, readable, and adaptable. Overall, this project was a valuable learning experience, reinforcing the importance of clean code, efficient algorithms, and robust error handling.
